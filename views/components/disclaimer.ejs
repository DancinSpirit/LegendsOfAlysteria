        <p class="boxtext story-disclaimer">Hi! Thanks for reading LoA! ^_^ If you're looking for a specific event, please click the Table of Contents in the top left and navigate to where you're trying to read! You can also change the text, transition, sound, and scroll-type settings by clicking the gear in the upper right corner. Turns -3 through 4 include "From Shadows Into Light" segments. These segments follow the story of Keith Zandros, a character from Conquering High Fantasy, LoA's predecessor, and establish his presence in the story. They are a bit meandering and don't neccessarily reflect the experience of playing LoA, but they establish Keith's place in the world of LoA and I so I elected to include them. Feel free to skip these sections if they aren't of interest to you. Thanks for reading! ^_^</p>
